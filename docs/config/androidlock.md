### Configuration Options

#### Default Launcher

_Second_ can be set as the default app launcher. This will make it the home screen of the device, preventing users from accessing other apps.

You may use the configuration menu to un-set _Second_ as the default launcher when needed.

#### Immersive/Fullscreen UI

This will hide the system navigation and status bars, and run the app in fullscreen mode.

#### Absorb Volume Keys

This will prevent the volume buttons from changing the device volume.
