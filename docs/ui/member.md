!!! Warning
    Admin members may require a PIN code, if configured. 
    If the admin hasn't created a PIN yet, they will be requested to do so within the app.

## UI Elements

### 1. Clock In Button

The clock in button will clock the member in. 
The timestamp and selected location will be recorded in the [activity log](../google_setup/sheet.md#log-sheet).

### 2. Clock Out Button

The clock out button will clock out the member.
The timestamp **only** will be recorded in the [activity log](../google_setup/sheet.md#log-sheet).

### 3. Location Selection

The location selector will select the location to clock in to.
It will not be visible if the member is currently clocked in.
The locations can be configured in the app's configuration.

### 4. Member Profile Image

The profile image currently only displays the member's initials. 
Image support may be added in the future.

### 5. Member ID

The member ID is the unique identifier used in the sheet.
The RFID tag's UID must match this for it to work.

### 6. Back Button
